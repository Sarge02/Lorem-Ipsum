            <p>I own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. 
                Four ruffians break into my house. "What the devil?" As I grab my 
                powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through 
                the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely
                 because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the 
                 stairs loaded with grape shot, "Tally ho lads" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra 
                 shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the 
                 police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended.</p>
